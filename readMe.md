# StarPlus

### Python 3.9+ is required to run the compiler.

## ~~Building runtime from source~~
~~If you would like to build the runtime (C) from source, you need to have Clang or GCC installed.~~

~~run the `build-runtime.sh` that is located script in this directory. And the starpc program should be recompiled.~~

## Adding to path
You may need to add this directory to the system path in order to access the `starp` and `starpc` commands from anywhere. (See __languageGuide.md__)
